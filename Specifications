The main purpose of the recorder is to keep the last active time record and to updates it into the database when requested.

- When started, it creates a new record and inserts it in the database. The record is kept for further updates.
- When stampped, it updates the EndTime of the existing record and also updates it in the database.
- When stopped, it updates the EndTime of the existing record, updates it in the database and "forgets" about it.
