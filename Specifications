Recorder
--------
The main purpose of the recorder is to keep the last active time record and to updates it into the database when requested.

- When started, it creates a new record and inserts it in the database. The record is kept for further updates.
- When stampped, it changes the EndTime of the existing record and updates it into the database.
- When stopped, it changes the EndTime of the existing record, updates it into the database and "forgets" about it.

Important methods:
- Start()
- Stamp()
- Stop(bool deleteLastRecord)

It has a public property that specifies the state of the recorder:
public RecorderState State { get; set; }

Four events:
- Started
- Stopped
